# Agile Challengers : Creation Presurgical Epilepsy Evaluation Platform

The primary objective of the project is to create a web application that provides neurosurgeons with an easy-to-use interface for interacting with three-dimensional patient brain models. Surgeons can handle and analyze complex anatomical components with greater precision by using modern 3D modeling technology, which improves pre-operative planning and eventually results in better surgical outcomes.
